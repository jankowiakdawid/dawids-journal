title: Performance and design
author: Dawid Jankowiak
summary: The last week was full of performance considerations, but I found time to think about my career path too and a bit about colorful gradients.

## When performance is not important

<Tweet id="1367853852628811777" />

This funny tweet from David seems a good entry point to talk about performance.
Somehow the topic popped up twice this week in the content I've consumed...

### Why GTA Online is slow to load?

First, at the beginning of the week, there was this article
[How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/)
by [t0st](https://github.com/tostercx).

This incredible story goes deep into debugging and profiling GTA Online without original source code,
to understand why the loading times are sooooo slow.

The effort is admirable, and what's even better they were able to figure it out
and patch it!

The only sad part is that this needed to be done by the "user".

### Ranting on slow programs

During his Twitch stream, discussion in the chat started on how fast Apple new M1 processors are
and [Jon](https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow) was asked about his views on this and how it may affect the game industry.

This is the relevant part of the stream [Let's Improve! Compiler at 2h 14m 13s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/820854910?t=02h14m13s).
At first, he was dismissive, but then he did a short rant on how those processors will be used to run slower programs in the future
because the programmers will waste this speed. Maybe on inefficient JSON parsing ðŸ¤”.

I think that Jon has a point. That by changing how we write our programs they can be way faster.
I don't think Jon is the only one how noticed it and started to do something about this. They are
others. As a professional Front-End developer, I see that tools that put performance first are popping
around us.

### Tools that are actually faster

From bundlers like [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and compilers like [SWR](https://swc.rs/),
to build tools like [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
and all-in-one like [Rome](https://rome.tools/) which runs eslint rules faster than eslint itself.

But that's only for the programmerâ€™s convenience, what about the end-users? Here the story gets more
complicated because I'm not aware of many tools that would put the performance as a priority.
There are two noticeable exceptions though [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com) and [Linear](https://linear.app)
both adhere to the same 100 ms rule. As Superhuman explains it on its website:

> The creator of Gmail, Paul Buchheit, had a rule: every interaction should be faster than 100ms. Why? Because 100ms is the threshold where interactions feel instantaneous.

At first, I would say that this is a new wave of tools and in some time everything will be faster.  
But let's be honest, that's not the case. Superhuman and Linear are niche tools targeting people
who need this speed because they busy with something more important.

### Do we really need to be fast?

Along comes my friend [Radek](https://twitter.com/singlespl?s=20), during a short discussion about
this he pointed out that firstly by upgrading to a faster processor the programs that you run will
get faster.
That was the case with the loading times of GTA Online.
But also, in the future, this will give more opportunities to write slower programs.

What we've agreed with Radek is that not everything needs to be blazing fast. There is this
sweet spot of _"fast enough"_. Companies like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) and
[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) can be successful despite being written in Ruby.

There's this mantra **Make it work, make it right, make it fast** that I've heard few times
throughout my career in software. Maybe it's a [misconseption](https://henriquebastos.net/the-make-it-work-make-it-right-make-it-fast-misconception/)
to understand it as an independend steps, or maybe it's the pressure from Product People to
deliver something working **now**.  
I know from my own experience that in big companies with many people/teams working on the same code base
readability and maintainability are way more important than the cleverness of fast code.

### Code for computers

As [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com) once famously said

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

The thing is that it's the computer that will run the code,
and for the computer to run it fast it may expect something a bit different than the human.

Compilers try their best to be the bridge to solve this challenge and let us write something that will
be readable to humans as well as fast to run for computers. Tools like [Prepack](https://prepack.io)
try to take it a step further.

But sometimes you need to give it a win and write something unreadable, so itâ€™ll be fast,
like for example [Fast Inverse Square Root in A Quake III](https://youtu.be/p8u_k2LIZyo).

### Uninformed opinion design

When I was thinking about writing this _Journal_ I realized that most of the time I'll be sharing
my own opinions, that in most cases will be uninformed, or will lack deep thought or insights/research.

Because I don't want to spend months investigating topics, analyzing facts, etc. I came up with
a workaround. I'll put those _uninformed opinions_ in a box saying that they uninformed and opinions.

Major halves of the two sections above should be in those boxes. The reason they don't is embarrassingly simple.

I didn't design how those boxes should look...

I'm a fan of modern flat designs with elements of gradients and blurs. Like in this design of cards.

<Tweet id="1367598661203611651" />

This issue is, I spent time setting up the Journal and writing this entry,
I needed to say _"not today"_ to the box.

### Future

I'll add it in the future, alongside the RSS and Dark Theme, and ... oh, I have so many ideas
that it's easy to feel overwhelmed. So, for now, I'll focus on incremental improvements and writing.

### Inter path to IC career

This week I've learned that there's a catchy name for not being a manager in a company: _individual contributor_.
The IC abbreviation was used many times in this [interview](https://staff.design/rasmus-andersson)
with [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/).

Rasmus is a designer for Figma nowadays, but as he stated he used to be a manager and software engineer.
In the interview he talks about what being a designer means to him. I've learner a bit more about
designer perspective and work process, which is nice because the design is something that I would like
to be good at.

I like how he clearly outlines his way of thinking and wording.
The choice of being IC or manager for him is a choice between with whom you'll spend
the most time with coworkers or end-users.
Or how he advises thinking about design skills, instead of saying desktop/android,
he suggests thinking about stationary interface and handheld interface.

I'll spend the next few days thinking about it.

I hope Rasmus will spend upcoming days happy cause his typeface [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
will be the [default in Elementary OS](https://blog.elementary.io/look-and-feel-changes-elementary-os-6/#typography).

### Closing notes

I could go on and on. There are so many things to say.
Unfortunately, this takes more time than I've anticipated,
and I don't want to put pressure on myself to write a book.

As I said, small steps ðŸ˜‰

I'll end this with this [shanties cover](https://youtu.be/y12oQzvhX3g).
