summary: This is not a blog. Then what is it?!

After years of reading blogs and various posts, I concluded that to have one you
need to have something to say. Either you're smart and have many on-point observations,
or you are a teacher trying to teach a new language/framework/method, etc.

This with a combination of my little imposter syndrome and my fear of sounding stupid
was enough for me to not have one. On top there's my dyslexia and my English skills, and...

So, there I was thinking of having a blog, and unable to convince myself to create one.
As usually in such situationâ€™s universe finds a way.
This time the way's name was [Frank](https://twitter.com/DieKrallee), my friend from work.
Recently though I found a way around this.

He pointed out that all those links I'm sending him could be placed on the blog.
I thought a bit about this.

And I found a word for what this is. This is a "Journal". You can think about it as a newsletter too.
For me, it's a place where I'll be putting all the interesting things I've run into and read/watched
with my semi-first thoughts.

Credits where it's due:

Next.js, by Lee. Inspiration for the designs comes from [Staff.design](https://staff.design/)
