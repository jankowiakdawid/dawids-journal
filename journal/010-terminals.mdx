## Terminals

## Cool kid on the block

Suddenly out of nothing I run on a blog post introducing
[a new terminal - Wrap](https://blog.warp.dev/the-terminal-is-on-life-support-is-it-worth-saving/).
A few weeks ago I was wondering why we stopped having better UI for things in
our Editors, and here comes better UI for the terminal. Nice validation.
It has an impressive set of features. Being able to navigate when writing
a command *with* multi-cursor support seems mind-blowing.
Integrated autocomplete looks similar to [Fig](https://fig.io/).
Although collaboration features like shared sessions and chat, look good for
remote pairing when problem-solving, I'm a bit worried that this will make
this terminal expensive and subscription model.

Is it a viable idea to pay a monthly fee for a terminal?
Or maybe the terminal will be free and one would need to go PRO for sharing?
ðŸ¤”

## Why so slow?

The other reason discovering Wrap was interesting to me is that I found it the day
after watching [Casey Muratori's](https://twitter.com/cmuratori?s=20)
stream about [refterm](https://youtu.be/hxM8QmyZXtg).
His demo showcasing how fast terminals should be in rendering text, and why
we shouldn't be so excited about
[Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
despite [it's many features](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-use-open-resize-and-split-panes-in-the-windows-terminal).

I don't do native desktop programming but I like Casey's explanations about the inner
workings of the terminal, and the problems with APIs that he run into, and how
he solved them. The results he got in a benchmark were mind-blowing.

The software can be fast... Who could know?

### Shell prompt

While speaking about terminals, having a nice prompt is almost as important.

I'm using [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for quite some time,
not because it's written in Rust.
My main motivation was the out-of-the-box minimal design and its speed.

Before I was using [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash),
but it was noticeably slow when showing Git info. Starship is much faster.

## Feature branching

While traversing Twitter I've seen Dan quoting part of an article

<Tweet id="1415586807031402504" />

And I cannot agree more with this. I had this thought some years ago. 
After reading the whole [article](https://thinkinglabs.io/articles/2021/07/14/on-the-evilness-of-feature-branching-a-tale-of-two-teams.html)
I can also share how hard it is to convince others.

I had a similar discussion with colleagues resulting in still doing feature branching.
For some reason, people prefer doing big Pull-Requests.
Although I understand that having a top-notch Continues Delivery pipeline to support
trunk-based development isn't something that comes easy and cheap.

I think that somehow we got so used to doing code reviews and working with branches,
that we stopped remembering how we used to work without it...

## Into Stitches

[Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) is an interesting CSS-in-JS library that
has a very small size and also is very performant.
The most interesting thing about it is that it comes without a `Provider`,
it doesn't need it.

The second key feature for me is that it has out-of-the-box support for
[design tokens](https://stitches.dev/docs/tokens).

Recently [Pedro Duarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte)
got interviewed by the
[CodingCatDev podcast](https://youtu.be/5hyGWA2SHk8)
and was talking about Stitches, as well as the whole CSS-in-JS trend,
and the inspirations for it.

I'm a huge fan of the [variant API](https://stitches.dev/docs/variants),
but the idea of using variants in combination with
[responsive styles](https://stitches.dev/docs/responsive-styles) as an
alternative to media queries sounds very powerful and novel.

I use [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) on the daily basis,
which also has Variant API and responsive styles. Stitches look like
the next step in evolution, more capable with better TypeScript support,
smaller and faster.

## Key prop

The other day [Dan](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) wrote a blog post
as a Twitter thread about React
[key prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys).

### Svelte version

Later someone asked [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris) how
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is handling those cases and
he responded with a link to [`each` docs](https://svelte.dev/docs#each).

### Vue

Not surprisingly Vue also has a
[`key` attribute](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/special-attributes.html#key)
for the very same reasons.

Although there were few
[breaking changes](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/key-attribute.html#overview)
between the versions.

### Conclusion

As you can see all those frameworks have this form of an attribute. So learning
from Dan's approachable explanation you learn not only React
but also Vue and Svelte, in some way.

## Game architecture

I like to watch some GDC presentations from time to time, learning about
how to design games. YouTube algorithm presented me a talk from the
[Roguelike Celebration](https://roguelike.club/) conference by
[Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)
about [game architecture patterns](https://youtu.be/JxI3Eu5DPwE).

Bob's explanation of [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
finally helped me understand the concept.
Then he showed how ECS can be used to have composable capabilities for items.
Like for a sword that has a ranged attack but also can throw a fireball
and can be used to defend.

Bob also explains other code patterns in terms of solutions to problems
you can run into while writing a game. Some of the patterns reminded me
of how Fred George suggested writing
[Simple code](/journal/004-simple#Simple).

## Extracting a type of array element in TypeScript

The other day I was working with a big and nested type that was generated
for me by Apollo based on our GraphQL schema.

### Removing null from unions

I wanted to remove `null`s which was quite easy to do with help of the build-in
[`NonNullable` utility](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#nonnullabletype).

I'm not a fan of the [non-null assertion operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#non-null-assertion-operator-postfix-).
It looks lazy and hacky and sometimes I'm just too paranoid to trust it.

`NonNullable` was great, but it doesn't work on objects, and just to remove
one level of `null`s I created one more utility.

```typescript
type NonNullableObject<T> = {
    [P in keyof T]: NonNullableT[P]>;
};
```

This can be used in [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
for [array filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
callback to remove elements with `null`s.

### Get array element type

The other challenge was how to get the type out of the array. I found two solutions.
The first was to use a similar utility generic type to `infer` element type.

(Side note: Sadly I cannot find a good documentation for it, the best that search
shows me is [Inferring with conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/conditional-types.html#inferring-within-conditional-types))

```
type ArrayElement<ArrayType> = ArrayType extends (infer ElementType)[]
    ? ElementType
    : never;
```

Then I've stumbled upon the old post on
[How to get types from arrays](https://steveholgado.com/typescript-types-from-arrays/)
that offer simpler solutions and dives into how it works.

I've created [a small playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/MYewdgzgLgBAhmAlgWzgGwjAvDA2gKBhgG8YIAHAU2EUogC4YByYOKJgGhjDmUsaYAxNAFcAZmICeTGAF8OhEmSo06AgCYgA5p269+zQYk0z5i0hWq0GzZCBERKunnwEAVAE6UAbiA+n8AF18fChJKhgAQQ8POEkAUTRKPjAoAB5o2Mk3cMoAPmwomLiciMoADyhKMHVMAApEMDFKDxhE5OqoUsoASlxgoiIAfjaklK7cxSJGMB8WgG4QsIjIpFQ0AEZC5coQMXg19AhcMBFkACMW4NDcqMO0ACZCzLj28bSdvYOUI7ygA)
so you can see them side by side and choose whichever you prefer.
