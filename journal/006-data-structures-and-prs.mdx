## Melange

Last week I was writing about [ReScript](/journal/005-finite-patterns-of-machines#What's-ReScript?)
and there was a thing I omitted because I couldn't find a link.

Well, I found the week unexpectedly this week ðŸ™‚
When [AntÃ³nio N. Monteiro](https://twitter.com/_anmonteiro) posted on Twitter
the new name for his fork of BuckleScript - **Melange**.

<Tweet id="1375967027433644033" />

I like [Frank Herbert's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert) Dune universe.
(OCaml build tool is called [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune))

Here is the initial story and rationale behind the fork -
[On OCaml and the JS platform](https://anmonteiro.com/2021/03/on-ocaml-and-the-js-platform/)

And here is a trailer for the upcoming [Dune movie](https://youtu.be/n9xhJrPXop4).

## Deno company

From other news, Deno announced its new [Company](https://deno.com/blog/the-deno-company)
and raised $4.9M in the seed round. They'll use the money not only to make Deno more
awesome but also to build their cloud called [Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

It describes itself as

> a distributed system that allows you to run JavaScript, TypeScript,
> and WebAssembly close to users, at the edge, worldwide.

Which I would bet is using [`deno_core` create](https://crates.io/crates/deno_core)
underneath. Rayn talks about it numerous times in his talks as a better way of
embedding JS runtime into other tools like databases or serverless at the edge.
For example [at his JS fest 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/z6JRlx5NC9E?t=2268).

## Out of NodeJS

Rust is well known to be a performant language. That's one of its main reasons to be.
This week I've read a comparison of Rust [Actix-Web](https://actix.rs/) and
[ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/).

Here's the story - [ExpressJS vs Actix-Web](https://medium.com/@maxsparr0w/performance-of-node-js-compared-to-actix-web-37f20810fb1a).

There are no surprises there. Long story short Rust version has a smaller memory
footprint less CPU usage and can handle much more traffic.

Why even compare the two? I would say that the so we would need to think too much
about when to move out of Node. Node is great don't get me wrong.
_But_ on some scale, it's not the best tool for the job.
And comparisons like this show when would be a good moment to rethink our choices.

### Going Go

You may remember that a few years ago one of the biggest contributors to the Node ecosystem,
the author of ExpressJS [TJ Holowaychuk](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk)
[left Node in favor of Go](https://medium.com/code-adventures/farewell-node-js-4ba9e7f3e52b).

I would say that Go is a much simpler language that Rust is a compelling reason to start with it.
Also for NodeJS programmers the which are not used to compiling the fast compile times of
Go programs can be easier to bear with than
[the slowness of the Rust compiler](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dl4c8o/is_the_rust_compiler_really_that_slow/).

Ryan Dahl thinks the same, listen to his [quote from JSConf EU 2018](https://youtu.be/M3BM9TB-8yA?t=194).

**But** there's always a but. At some scale, you just need more raw speed. This reminds me of the time when Discord
[rewrote their service from Go to Rust](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)
to get more speed.

## JavaScript's not slowly

One reason why Ryan is pushing for performant JS/TS runtime is cause _"dynamic languages are nice for
prototyping"_.

This week I've learned that not only ExpressJS is not the fastest but also a bit outdated and not highly
maintained these days. All this from one article about
[how to migrate to fastify](https://www.sitepoint.com/express-to-fastify-migrate/).
The numbers they show in their [benchmark](https://www.fastify.io/benchmarks/) is look quite good.
I also like that they advise benchmarking for yourself.

## Speeding Jest

This week I've learned this little weird trick [how to speed Jest](https://ivantanev.com/make-jest-faster/).
I tested and it looks like I could get back a 1-2s on every `npm t` run. Not much but every second
count.

I put this on top of my other trick. Which is using a faster loader like for example
[@swc-jest](https://swc.rs/docs/usage-swc-jest).

From my fast check, it seems that you get better results with `@swc/jest` than limiting workers.
Although you may need to put more work because in two repos that I've tried I always encounter some.

### Alternative

Of course, you may also want to try a different runner. Like for example [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu).
We also have [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) at work that can run 10k unit tests in 40 s.
But I don't know how they did it...

## Importance of data structures

There was also another story of [going away from Node](https://acco.io/i-escaped-node).
This time to Elixir. My takeaway from it is a story in the middle about data structures.
It's a very nice story with a quote attributed to [Rob Pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike) (one of Go's creators).

> Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well,
> the algorithms will almost always be self-evident.
> Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

### Recois scaling fix

This is how [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) improved performance for a really large number of atoms, by using
[a better data structure](https://recoiljs.org/blog/2021/03/22/0.2.0-released/#scaling-to-large-numbers-of-atoms).

I wasn't aware that there was a scaling problem in the first place, but also I knew nothing about
[hash array mapped trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie).

### Rust BTreeMap

Somewhere in many of my open tabs there was article about
[implementing BTreeMap in Rust](https://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/rust-btree-case/).

I think that this article is a good showcase of how complicated language Rust can be.
It contains lifetimes, generics, and closures. That's a lot to digest at one go.

If you're interested, like I were, here you can see an implementation of
[BTree in Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/btree).

### Dataless

Rob Pikes quote made me think about an email I once read from [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay)
where he said

> I wanted to get rid of data.

You can find it in the answer to the question about
[the meaning of "Object-Oriented Programming"](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en).
Together with little history of creating [SmallTalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk)
and inspirations behind it.

### Reconcilliation

Although I don't have a clear understanding if it's even possible to reconcile those two quotes,
I have a suspicion that it may be a similar
[functional core imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell).

I'm not quite sure about what would be the order here, cause as Dan once mentioned
React does this the other way around.

<Tweet id="1093945894410571778" />

My first guess is that from a Software Design perspective you can try to hide data and have them only
as an internal implementation detail. But isn't that something that we're already doing?

Maybe there's more to in the [Dataless programming memorandum](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2007/RM5290.pdf)?

## PRs

This week [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron) put into the words my frustrations about pull requests
probably better than I would in the article titled
[Those pesky pull requests reviews](https://jessitron.com/2021/03/27/those-pesky-pull-request-reviews/).

For quite some time I grew tired of pull requests. For one because I usually have some issues with them :|
But also because it seems to me that they make the organization slower in spaces where it's painful.

I especially agree with the argument that although they can be a good tool for open source
they don't make especially too much sense in a company environment.

Her article brings much-appreacieted acknowledgment to my fillings cause many of
my colleagues are way more enthusiastic about PRs than I am.

### Limbo

Another person from which I've heard criticism of sort was [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck)
when talking about his time at Facebook. Kent went a step further and propose a solution of a sort.
About both you can read in his post -
[Libmo: Scaling Software Collaboration](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/limbo-scaling-software-collaboration-afd4f00db4b).

I'm aware that this could sound chaotic at first, but Kent has a good track record of implementing
and making popular oddly sounding ideas
([XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/), [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).

### Dark

Maybe the future is closer than we think if we take into consideration that
[Dark can deploy code in 50ms](https://medium.com/darklang/how-dark-deploys-code-in-50ms-771c6dd60671).

Why spend the whole day reviewing code that can be put in prod, or taken down, faster than you can read this line?

### History

In [2006 Guido van Rossum presented "Mondrian"](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/game-changers/index.html#mondrian-2006)
to Googlers, one of the first web-based code review platform. During his talk, he mentions
[that code review is the best alternative to pair programming](https://youtu.be/sMql3Di4Kgc?t=325).
So maybe if you can it's better to do pair programing than bother with code review ðŸ¤”

### Future

Or maybe I'm biased only because of the lack of better tools?
A few years ago I was reading about a
[tool for code reviews from Jane Street](https://blog.janestreet.com/putting-the-i-back-in-ide-towards-a-github-explorer/).
Iron was quite an Iron Tower for me, it is an internal tool of theirs and requires Emacs.

Fortunately, nowadays there's a similar tool for [GitHub and VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run it for the On-Premise Enterprise version of GitHub.

Maybe I should try [CodeStream](https://www.codestream.com)...
