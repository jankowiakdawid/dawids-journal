I've opened Twitter today to see this

<Tweet id="1396252890721918979" />

Telling everybody that it's better to use `.filter` `.map` and `.reduce` that
doing everything in one go.

Then [Jamie](https://twitter.com/buildsghost?s=20) tweeted

<Tweet id="1396504576413470720" />

Concerned about performance.

But it's cheap to talk showing some little examples and not measuring anything.
My procrastination hit me and I felt the urge to measure it!

Sadly, the [jsperf.com](https://jsperf.com/) isn't working. So I needed to find a different way.
Fortunately, we now have [`console.time`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/time)
so I've prepared small examples to test it.

## Bug

Before we start there's one thing we should mention. Theres a bug in the tweet.
The proposed solution

```
users
  .filter((user) => !user.active)
  .map((user) => ({ [user.id]: user.name }))
  .reduce(Object.assign, {});
```

If run on this example data set

```
let users = [
  { id: 1, active: false, name: 'Hank' },
  { id: 2, active: false, name: 'John' },
];
```

will be unexpetedly

```
{ '0': { '1': 'Hank' }, '1': { '2': 'John' }, '2': 'John' }
```

In order to understand why is that we need to look at `reduce`
[documention](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce).
There we will notice that the syntax can be
`reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => { ... }, initialValue)`
and that last argument is the culprit here.

You see, `Object.assign` as its [docs page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
say

> copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object

> _enumerable own properties_

Let's see what happens here.

1. The first call of the reduce would have the following argument passed to it:

```
  reduce({}, { 1: 'Hank' }, 0, [{ 1: 'Hank' }, { 2: 'John' }])
```

And the same arguments would be passed to `Object.assign`.

The first one is an initial empty object as the target.
The second one is the first result from `.map`.

Until here we would be good, the result would be simply `{1: 'Hank'}`.
But we still have few arguments left. The next one is the array index `0`.
Numbers don't have enumerable properties so we're good, the result would still,
be `{1: 'Hank'}`.
And then there's the last argument, the array.
We can check what are array enumerable properties with
[`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptors).

the result is:

```
{
  '0': {
    value: { '1': 'Hank' },
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
  },
  '1': {
    value: { '2': 'John' },
    writable: true,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
  },
  length: { value: 2, writable: true, enumerable: false, configurable: false }
}
```

Two enumerable properties.
This is what we're getting as a result

```
{ '0': { '1': 'Hank' }, '1': { '2': 'John' } }
```

Notice how we shadowing the previous `1: 'Hank'` with `'1': { '2': 'John' }`.

2. Then the `.reduce` would carry on and applied the second set of arguments that would be

```
.reduce(
  { '0': { '1': 'Hank' }, '1': { '2': 'John' } },
  { '2': 'John' },
  1,
  [{ 1: 'Hank' }, { 2: 'John' }]
)
```

And the same things would happen. But this time we also get a surprising result.

```
{ '0': { '1': 'Hank' }, '1': { '2': 'John' }, '2': 'John' }
```

We have doubled the last entry, but somehow it got flattened.
Well, this time it's just the fault of the example. This is because we have two facts.
First I have simple numbers as `id`s. Second `Object.assign` applies entries from left to
right shadowing the ones with overlapping property names.
There was not a property name called `2` in the resulting object so it was applied, and the array
enumerable properties don't have a property called `2` either so it wasn't shadowed by anything.

### Conclusion

As [Jake Archibald]() was warning
[don't use functions as callbacks unless they're designed for it](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/function-callback-risks/)
and `Object.assign` wasn't.

## Performace

Let's bet back to check the performance.
I've prepared a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jankowiakdawid/78efb8199ebe49a046f3f5c258a9fab0) with
few examples.
There I have a few examples:

1. Original example

```
users.reduce((acc, user) => {
  if (!user.active) {
    return acc;
  }
  return { ...acc, [user.id]: user.name };
}, {});
```

2. Original buggy proposed improvment

```
users
  .filter((user) => !user.active)
  .map((user) => ({ [user.id]: user.name }))
  .reduce(Object.assign, {})
```

3. Fixed with object spread and dropped `.map` because it wasn't needed

```
users
  .filter((user) => !user.active)
  .reduce((acc, user) => ({ ...acc, [user.id]: user.name }), {});
```

4. Fixed with object property assign, still witout uneeded `.map`

```
users
  .filter((user) => !user.active)
  .reduce((acc, user) => {
    acc[user.id] = user.name;
    return acc;
  }, {});
```

Notice how we must have explicit return here.

5. How I would write it using [`Object.fromEntries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries)

```
Object.fromEntries(
  users
    .filter((user) => !user.active)
    .map((user) => [user.id, user.name])
);
```

6. `for of` that Jamie proposed

```
let inactiveUsers = {};
for (let user of users) {
  if (!user.active) {
    inactiveUsers[user.id] = user.name;
  }
}
```

7. And classical `for` loop, just because

```
let inactiveUsers = {};
for (let i = 0, length = users.length; i < length; i++) {
  let user = users[i];
  if (!user.active) {
    inactiveUsers[user.id] = user.name;
  }
}
```

I've run these examples with variant array size in Node to compare how do they perform.
