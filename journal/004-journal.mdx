## GTA Online happy ending

Two weeks ago I'd shared a story about [GTA Online loading times](/journal/002-real-first#Why-GTA-Online-is-slow-to-load?),
this week brought a resolution! In an [update](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/#Update-2021-03-15)
t0st informerd that Rockstar reached to them and granted them with their **$10k** in-game bounty.
Seems like time well spent on investigation!

Day after bug fix got released and loading times went down to _only_ 2 mins.

## Remixing performance

What started as a joke became a self burn. But the intersting outcome of it is that I've found that maybe [Remix](https://remix.run/)
will join [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

Following the thread I've learned that [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) file search were lately [rewriten in Rust](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/5481).
It seem that in the future Parcel may be using [SWC]()

Maybe in the future all our tooling will be writen in compiled languages providing native like speed.
This begs a question: is it still worth while to write tools in JS?

Well, probably not ðŸ˜…

But as [Rome](https://rome.tools/) author suggest [we may be good with TS](https://github.com/rome/tools/issues/144#issuecomment-595464330) ðŸ˜‰

## SOLID CUPID

[Dan North](https://twitter.com/tastapod?s=20) wrote why he doesn't like SOLID principles - [CUPID - the back story](https://dannorth.net/2021/03/16/cupid-the-back-story/).
As he exlains this is based on a short talk he once gave. Based only on the [slides from this talk](https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong) orginal author of
[SOLID Principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) - [Robert Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin?s=20) wrote
[his response](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html).

### Deconstruction

This sound like a good _tech drama_, but SOLID principles were qritiqued years before by [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney?s=20)
in his talk [The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed](https://youtu.be/tMW08JkFrBA).

### Simple

It's impossible to not mention about fenomendal talk by [Rich Hickey](https://twitter.com/richhickey?s=20) [Simple made easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/),
where he digs into the meaing of word _simple_. He identifies that one of the property of simple code is that it's simple to change.
[Dan Abramow](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov?s=20) also wrote about this in, rather shor take on [optimizing for change](https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/).

Also [Fred George](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-george) talks about simple clode in the talk
[The Secret Assumption of Agile](https://youtu.be/l1Efy4RB_kw).
Which I like very much, cause for me at least it sounds inspireing and started me on a path to learn how to write simple code.
Although I need to admit that it's very voughe and don't provide much evidence.

### Path to Simple OO

Fred says that he spent years learning how to write simple code, and that we can learn too if we watch [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz?s=20).
So I've spent last two years watching Santi talks on YouTube  
[here's](https://youtu.be/YtROlyWWhV0)
[a few](https://youtu.be/29MAL8pJImQ)
[examples](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE).
The thing all of them are for Ruby, and as simple as Ruby not its all idioms translates well to other languages.
I also saw this critique of some of Sandi's [expamples](https://youtu.be/IRTfhkiAqPw) (but now only her code is looked into).

### Let's just wait

This is huge topic, and I don't have neither time nor will power to give it true justice.
So lets wait what Dan will show us in a followup story.

### Write simply

While we wait lets consider one more thing. At 2019 React Conf [Jenn Creighton](https://twitter.com/gurlcode?s=20) give a talk [React is Fiction](https://youtu.be/kqh4lz2Lkzs).
In it she draws comaprisons between writing fictions and writing React components.
Starting from classical _"Show, don't tell"_, going through character (component) motivations, and writing what you know, to rewriting.
I really like how almost all quotes she presented can apply directly to the craft of _writing_ programs.

Lately [Paul Graham]() wrote an essey on [writing simply](http://paulgraham.com/simply.html). He clearly talks about writing esseys,
but it's not a long streach to view it by prism of _writing_ programs. One of the very first thing I've learnd in my first job was
that I don't need to use every esoteriq feature of a language to make the code fit into least amount of lines. That it's easier
for others (and my future self) when I use ordinar constructs and well known patterns.

Reducing jargon is also one of the core [technical philosophies of Rome](https://rome.tools/#technical).

## Clubhouse

An [emerging social platform](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/) somehow found in the center of my interest this week.
Which is quite strange as I don't own iPhone so I cannot join.

### DogeHouse

But first I've run into a [DogeLog](https://youtu.be/1PBNAoKd-70).
It wasn't the first time I've heard about the project, I saw the introduction video where it still was an [VS Code extention](https://youtu.be/hy-EhJ_tTQo).
As I'm more a visual person, and I get lost fast with audio only media, I ignored [DogeHouse](https://dogehouse.tv/) at first, thinking it's a joke.
Still I don't think I'll join but it was really nice to learn about it's [architecture](https://youtu.be/8YJqB4pNNgs).

### Hypotetical future of Clubhouse

Then I've run into this thread

<Tweet id="1371972261004070913" />

It's long so if you prefer [here's a blog version of it](https://mythreadreader.com/ShaanVP/1371972261004070913).
The qist it that Clubhouse focus real-time audio only may be really hard to scale to bigger audiance, and in time people will got bord with it.

### Competition

I also got reminded that [Kent C Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) build a similar feature into his
[Discord Community](https://kentcdodds.com/discord), called [Meetup](https://kentcdodds.com/meetups/#so-what-is-it).
Which sounds like Kent, going a step futher of being kind and inclusive to his community.

Also it looks like Telegram joined the game with the release of [Voice chats 2.0](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids).

## cURL

Recently [cURL](https://curl.se/) celebrated it's 23rd birthdays. This was an occasion for a [reflective post](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/03/20/curl-is-23-years-old-today/).
It's a story how a side project util tool becomes a hobby and then a men life work.
The story of cURL is a story about building over time, slow and steady growth and persistance. Builded upon UNIX philosophy the tool
found it's place as a backbone of modern day internet powering cars, games, TVs and what not.
The most mind blowing thing is how it grew over all those years. From merly 2,200 to outstandsing **172,000** today!

## Looping in python

I've run into this short (8m 5s) video on [looping in python](https://youtu.be/Qgevy75co8c).
Coming from JS where loop times are [quite equivelant](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/the-only-javascript-loop-benchmark-that-matters-for-the-most-of-us-77ec819eb23e)
I was suprised to learn that there is a difference between using `while` and `for` loop in it.
The straight forward explanation made it obvious why though. At the end I was quite blown away ðŸ¤¯.
