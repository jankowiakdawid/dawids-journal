## GTA Online happy ending

Two weeks ago I'd shared a story about [GTA Online loading times](/journal/002-real-first#Why-GTA-Online-is-slow-to-load?),
this week brought a resolution! In an [update](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/#Update-2021-03-15)
t0st informerd that Rockstar reached to them and granted them with their **$10k** in-game bounty.

Day after bug fix got released and loading times went down to _only_ 2 mins.

## Remixing performance

Seems like time well spent on investigation!

## SOLID CUPID

[Dan North](https://twitter.com/tastapod?s=20) wrote why he doesn't like SOLID principles - [CUPID - the back story](https://dannorth.net/2021/03/16/cupid-the-back-story/).
As he exlains this is based on a short talk he once gave. Based only on the [slides from this talk](https://speakerdeck.com/tastapod/why-every-element-of-solid-is-wrong) orginal author of
[SOLID Principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) - [Robert Martin](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin?s=20) wrote
[his response](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2020/10/18/Solid-Relevance.html).

### Deconstruction

This sound like a good _tech drama_, but SOLID principles were qritiqued years before by [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney?s=20) in his talk
[The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed](https://youtu.be/tMW08JkFrBA).

### Simple

It's impossible to not mention about fenomendal talk by [Rich Hickey](https://twitter.com/richhickey?s=20) [Simple made easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/),
where he digs into the meaing of word _simple_. He identifies that one of the property of simple code is that it's simple to change.
[Dan Abramow](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov?s=20) also wrote about this in, rather shor take on [optimizing for change](https://overreacted.io/optimized-for-change/).

Also [Fred George]() talks about simple clode in the talk [The Secret Assumption of Agile](https://youtu.be/l1Efy4RB_kw).
Which I like very much, cause for me at least it sounds inspireing and started me on a path to learn how to write simple code.
Although I need to admit that it's very voughe and don't provide much evidence.

### Path to Simple OO

Fred says that he spent years learning how to write simple code, and that we can learn too if we watch [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz?s=20).
So I've spent last two years watching Santi talks on YouTube here's few
[1](https://youtu.be/YtROlyWWhV0)
[2](https://youtu.be/29MAL8pJImQ)
[3](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE).
The thing all of them are for Ruby, and as simple as Ruby not its all idioms translates well to other languages.
I also saw this critique of some of Sandi's [expamples](https://youtu.be/IRTfhkiAqPw) (but now only her code is looked into).

### Let's just wait

This is huge topic, and I don't have neither time nor will power to give it true justice.
So lets wait what Dan will show us in a followup story.
